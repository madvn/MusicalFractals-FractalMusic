Musical_Fractals-Fractal_Music
============================

What makes music pleasant to listen to? Is there an inherent rule that composers follow without even knowing about it? Can we find those rules, if they exist, and if we find them can anyone who learns the rules become a great composer? These are some deep questions about music and its nature. We are hoping to scratch the surface here by making an analysis for power law existence in the note recurrence intervals in classical music and estimate its fractal dimension. We have made specific studies with Bach's bwv261 chorale and Mozart's K155. We have found presence of power law distribution in the note recurrence intervals for each note. We have also tried to incorporate the power law nature that we observed in Bach's bwv261 to create our own score programmatically.
